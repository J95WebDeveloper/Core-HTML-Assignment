          A stack is an arrangement of “things” kept in order one over the
          other. Tech stacks are sets of technologies that are stacked together
          to build any application. Popularly known as a technology
          infrastructure or solutions stack, tech stacks have become essential
          for building web applications that are easy to maintain and scalable.

          Tech stacks determine the type of applications you can build, the
          level of customizations you can perform, and the resources you need to
          develop your application.

          Modern tech stacks have many more components because of the increase
          in the number of devices from which users can access applications and
          the huge volumes of events and data processing. They might include
          tools for containerization, performance monitoring, business
          intelligence, event processing, data lakes, cloud services,
          microservices, and analytics. You should choose the tech stacks you
          want to use based on your project needs and other factors, which we
          will discuss later in this article.
